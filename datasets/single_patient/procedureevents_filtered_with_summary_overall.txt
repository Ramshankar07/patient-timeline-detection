**Patient:** ID 10005817  
**Date:** 2023-06-19  
**Time:** 15:45

The patient, a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes, presented to the clinic with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain was described as a sharp, stabbing sensation localized to the left side of the chest, radiating to the left arm. The patient reported that the pain started approximately 2 hours prior to presentation and has been persistent.

**Vital Signs:**

* Blood Pressure: 140/90 mmHg
* Heart Rate: 98 bpm
* Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute
* Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air

**Physical Examination:**

* General: The patient appears in mild distress due to chest pain.
* Cardiovascular: No murmurs or rubs, S1 and S3 present.
* Respiratory: Clear lung sounds bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles.
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.
* Extremities: No edema, no cyanosis.

**Assessment:**

* Probable angina pectoris
* Rule out myocardial infarction

**Plan:**

1. Administer nitroglycerin sublingually.
2. Obtain an ECG immediately.
3. Draw blood for cardiac enzymes (troponin, CK-MB).
4. Start IV access for potential further interventions.
5. Monitor patient closely in the observation unit.

The patient was administered nitroglycerin sublingually as ordered. ECG was performed, showing ST-segment depression in the inferolateral leads, suggestive of ischemia. Blood samples were sent to the lab for cardiac enzyme analysis. IV access was established without complications.

**Vital Signs:**

* Blood Pressure: 130/85 mmHg
* Heart Rate: 85 bpm
* Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air

The patient reported a reduction in chest pain intensity following nitroglycerin administration. Continuous monitoring was initiated.

Lab results returned showing elevated troponin levels, consistent with myocardial injury. The patient was administered aspirin 325 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg. Consultation with cardiology was requested for further management.

**Vital Signs:**

* Blood Pressure: 128/80 mmHg
* Heart Rate: 78 bpm
* Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute

**Time:** 08:00

Overnight, the patient remained stable with no recurrence of chest pain. Repeat ECG showed improvement in ST-segment changes. Cardiology team reviewed the case and recommended continuation of current medical management and outpatient follow-up in one week.

**Vital Signs:**

* Blood Pressure: 125/75 mmHg
* Heart Rate: 72 bpm
* Respiratory Rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air

The patient was discharged with instructions to take aspirin daily, atorvastatin nightly, and to follow up with cardiology as scheduled. Education provided on recognizing symptoms of myocardial infarction and when to seek immediate medical attention.
